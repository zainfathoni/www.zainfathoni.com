Welcome to my first talk! Back then, I talked about frontend stuff while I was still a backend developer at my day job.

It is based on a combination of [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) official documentation and [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) free video course on Egghead.
