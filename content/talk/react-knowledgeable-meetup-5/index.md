[Ninja Van](https://www.ninjavan.co) has established its presence in six countries across South East Asia for the past few years.

Recently we revamped our website using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) to enable us to customize its components in React.
This talk is a story about my ups and downs in getting i18n works properly at our website to serve those countries in [two](https://www.ninjavan.co) [different](https://www.ninjaxpress.co) domains.
