Surprised of too many things went wrong in your UI components? 🤔 <br />
Ever felt that freeing your components from bugs is a never-ending endeavour? 🤮 <br />
Familiar with this kind of code in React? 😏 <br />

```jsx
{!loading &&
  data &&
  !error &&
  !isHidden &&
  !isLoggedIn &&
  <YourComponent />}
```

State Machines to the rescue! 😎 <br /><br />
Join my journey in solving those kinds of issues using State Machines and see how they go in action with React Hooks. 🥳
